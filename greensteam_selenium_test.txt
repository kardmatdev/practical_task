Your task is to write a set of selenium test scenarios for pages accessible from https://manager.greensteam.com url.

Use python3, pytest & selenium. Organize the code however you like, but please provide instructions how to run it (requirements.txt or equivalent, readme file).

The tests will be run on Ubuntu Linux, using latest Firefox and geckodriver available
(geckodriver will be accessible in the PATH env variable).

Example command that can be used to start tests could look like this: (assuming geckodriver binary is in the current directory)
$ PATH=$PATH:. pytest test_module.py --driver=Firefox

Use page objects design pattern, assuming the code that you create is a part of a bigger test suite.

Also assume that the user John Doe (username: john@example.com, password: test) has an account on this website, and login using his username & password should be successfull and direct user to https://manager.greensteam.com/dashboard (it won't be, so expect that test to fail).

The time limit for this assignment is 4 hours.

Good luck!
